              <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
                var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
                They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
                While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.</p>

                Tell us the use cases of null and undefined

              <p>Null is an object in JavaScript and represents primitive data types. A null value in JavaScript is used for referring absence of any object value and if any function or variable returns null, then we can infer that the object could not be created.<br>
                The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.
